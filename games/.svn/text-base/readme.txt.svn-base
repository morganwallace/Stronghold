Map Maker Guide:
----------------
*Use the 'B' to place the base. Only the last 'B' placed will matter. To save a
    map, you MUST HAVE A BASE!
*Use the flags to set the corners of the paths. Use flag 1 for path 1, etc.
*The first flag for each path is the first corner for that path, the second is
    the second corner, etc.
*There's no way to erase flags or base yet. If you mess up, retry. I recommend
    doing the flags and base first, then do background work.
*Simply click the background tiles to place them on the background.
*When ready to save your map, just hit the 's' key.
*To enter text in these text boxes, hold your curser over them and type.
*The 'map name' is the name of the map and folder you want to save as.
*The Path number boxes, indicate which side of the screen the path will start
    from. For example, if Path 1: is set to 2, then path 1 will come from the
    top of the screen and down to the first flag, turn and go to the second
    flag, etc.

***mapproperties, which includes information about what waves of enemies to
    send, still needs to be done manually!!!
